# Micrograd Project
This is a project that is meant to be a deeper dive and learning opportunity about AI and machine learning for me, it is done by follwing Andreg Karpathy's tutorial linked here:

I have taken notes and my understandings as well as explanations in the project file, this is meant for myself but also for others in the case where they just want to read through it! If you have any critisism about my explanations or if something is wrong please do not hesistate to tell me, after all, I am learning a lot from this.
